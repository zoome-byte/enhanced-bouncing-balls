# Enhanced Bouncing Balls

This project is a creative extension of the classic Bouncing Balls canvas animation from MDN's JavaScript Objects tutorial. It adds interactive and visually engaging features using vanilla JavaScript and the HTML5 `<canvas>` element.

## ✨ Features

- 🖱️ **Click to remove** a ball from the canvas
- 🌈 **Color trails** create smooth motion effect
- 🔄 **Gravity toggle** using the "G" key
- 🔢 **Live ball counter** updates as balls are removed

## 💻 How to Run

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/enhanced-bouncing-balls.git
